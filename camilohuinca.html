        <h2>Camilo Huinca</h2>

            <p>Camilo Huinca's work is rich with colour, content and a brightly illustrated narrative that speaks for itself. 
                Born and raised in Santiago in Chile, Camilo has divided his career between graphic design and painting.</p>

                <p>Working independently has allowed Camilo to “develop (his) own style, having a main focus on the use of curiosity,” he explains.
                    In 2014 Camilo set up Perfe Studio where he concentrates on graphic design projects in “a more commercial way”.</p>

                    <p>However, within illustration, he described his main motivation as, “to be able to generate a communication method based on simplicity and synthesis, with few tools and colours.
                        I am interested in identifying people’s behaviour, portraying activities, intimate moments, body gestures, disfiguring objects and reducing the amount of detail in a composition.”</p>

                        <p>Camilo is fascinated by everyday scenes, moments and personal habits, often depicting scenic bus routes, art galleries and public figures in his own psychedelically shaped style.
                            “Within my work I try to reproduce real moments from an innocent and impartial perspective.”</p>
